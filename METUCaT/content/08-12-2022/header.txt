This week focuses on constructions of groups internal to categories, as well as providing group-theoretic constructions for categories. The internal constructions take place whenever a category has products.

The relevant sections in Awodey are:
* 4.1 Groups in a category
* 4.2 The category of groups
* 4.3 Groups as categories

Please check the following file(s) for notes on the exact subjects.
