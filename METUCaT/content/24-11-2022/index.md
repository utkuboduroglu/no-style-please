This week's content skips free constructions on categories, and instead focuses on the internal data of categories, such as: mono/epimorphisms, initial/terminal objects, (co)equalizers and pullbacks/pushouts, along with some basic examples and exercises:

The relevant chapters in Awodey are:
* 2.1, Epis and monos
* 2.2, Initial and terminal objects
* 2.3, Generalized objects
* 3.3, Equalizers
* 5.2, Pullbacks

Please check the following file(s) for notes on the exact subjects.
