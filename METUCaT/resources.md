title: Some references for category theory
---

To get you started on researching category theory-related subjects, here are some websites, articles and resources that contain categorical information.

## Books and resources on category theory
* Awodey, [Category Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Category-Theory-Oxford-Logic-Guides/dp/0199237182) (**our primary textbook**)
* Riehl, [Category Theory in Context](https://emilyriehl.github.io/files/context.pdf)
* Mac Lane, [Categories for the Working Mathematician](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-4721-8)
* Borceux, [Handbook of Categorical Algebra](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/handbook-of-categorical-algebra/A0B8285BBA900AFE85EED8C971E0DE14)

## Useful pages
* [ncatlab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) is like a wikipedia clone specifically for category theory, algebraic topology and much more.
* [math.stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/) and [mathoverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/) for asking questions and/or finding answers to relatively common questions you may have about the subject. These two pages are almost identical, so keep both in mind.
* [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/) for open access to a good collection of academic filters -- not necessarily restricted to category theory.
* [researchseminars.org](https://researchseminars.org/) is a website keeping track of published research seminars, with the capability of importing into calendars etc.
* [the n-category caf√©](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/) is a blog on anything category theory related from active category theorists.
* [topos institute](https://topos.site/) is a collective working on mathematical science and technology. They host workshops and seminars on category theory related subjects.
* [the stacks project](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/) is actually an "open source" textbook on algebraic geometry, but there is significant overlap with category theory -- most notably on sheaves.
* [Applied Category Theory conference](https://msp.cis.strath.ac.uk/act2022/) is a yearly conference focusing on the applications and applied aspects of category theory.

## Mailing lists
Most of the communication for research and development is usually through (somewhat archaic) mailing lists. Among many, two mailing lists contain the most volume for categorical subjects:

* [[categories](https://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/)], a mailing list solely focused on publishing workshops/conferences related to category theory,
* [[ALGTOP-L](https://www.lehigh.edu/~dmd1/algtop.html)], a mailing list for algebraic topology which sometimes contains content related to category theory.
