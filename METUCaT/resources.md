title: Some references for category theory
---

To get you started on researching category theory-related subjects, here are some websites, articles and resources that contain categorical information.

## Useful pages
* [ncatlab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) is like a wikipedia clone specifically for category theory, algebraic topology and much more.
* [the n-category caf√©](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/) is a blog on anything category theory related from active category theorists.
* [topos institute](https://topos.site/) is a collective working on mathematical science and technology. They host workshops and seminars on category theory related subjects.
* [the stacks project](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/) is actually an "open source" textbook on algebraic geometry, but there is significant overlap with category theory -- most notably on sheaves.
* [homotopy type theory](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/), a collective effort for applying notions of algebraic topology to mathematical logic and type theory using categorical constructions.
* [Applied Category Theory conference](https://msp.cis.strath.ac.uk/act2022/) is a yearly conference focusing on the applications and applied aspects of category theory.
