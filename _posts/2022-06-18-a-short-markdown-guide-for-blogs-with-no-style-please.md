This is to document the various things `no-style-please` allows in terms of markdown. Here is a math text snippet for testing out various rendering styles:

**Definition**: A _sheaf_ on a site $(C, J)$ is a presheaf $A\in \text{Set}^{C^\text{op}}$ such that the diagram below is an equalizer diagram:
$$
    A(U) \to \prod_i A(U_i) \rightrightarrows \prod_{j, k} \text{PSh}_C (y(U_j)\times_{yU} y(U_k), A)
$$
